## Learning Objectives Page Generator

How does this work?

On clicking Please generate learning objectives, the assistant reads through all the content in the assignment, and generates a page with 5-6 learning objectives, 
along with a teacher-view guidance block that details Assumptions/Pre-requisites for students as well as Limitations

This page will autonatically be added as the 1st page of the assignment.
